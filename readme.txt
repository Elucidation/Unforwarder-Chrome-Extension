This is a chrome extension which only runs on google search results pages.
It replaces all the google-forwarded search results links with the original links on page.

To use:
-Download the zip or tar.gz and unzip to a folder
-In Google Chrome click the top-right extensions icon -> Tools -> Extensions
-In the top right of inside window check Developer mode.
-Load unpacked extension, navigate and select unzipped folder
-Done.

While running, you can click the button to run on the google search result page directly if page took way too long to load.

If you want to see what it does:
-disable extension
-Do a google search for something random "Inception Corgi".
-Rightclick the first search link and choose 'Inspect Element' (in Chrome)
You'll see something long and ugly like:
http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=inception%20corgi&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBoQtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJaNc0YsQcNE&ei=-zayTuaBI5S2twfn4oXGBg&usg=AFQjCNHEw_Lns2zhuUNpaJnUjYIU5bND-w&sig2=pOmjXsuOL0zJgC1Fn0tjlQ
-Enable extension from extensions page, reload page
-Inspect again
You should see something like:
